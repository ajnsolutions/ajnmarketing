**Project name:** AJN Marketing ("Project Magic")

**Current product mission:** Make AJN Marketing feel like a small business hired the best Head of Marketing it could ever have — not like it bought another marketing tool. The product is evolving from an AI marketing platform into a broader "AI Growth Engine" for small businesses (Project Magic 2.0), with marketing as the first application of that intelligence.

**Current development phase:** Project Magic 2.0 (AI Growth Engine). Of the four planned waves in `docs/project-magic/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`:
- **Wave I** (Free Marketing Snapshot + Business Brain foundation) — shipped: public pre-auth Snapshot, secure SSRF-hardened backend contract, DNS-pinned continuation bridge, First Impression customer-facing UI, internal-alpha intelligence pass.
- **Wave II** (Connector Framework + Smart Uploads) — shipped: Business Connections foundation, Smart Uploads (PDF/DOCX/TXT/MD), Google Search Console as the first live Website & Search connector.
- **Wave III** (Customer Voice, Market Radar, Seasonal Intelligence) — partially shipped: Goals & Strategy shipped, Customer Voice Phase 1 + 2 shipped (Google Reviews + Website Testimonials providers). Market Radar's owner-managed persistence foundation shipped this session (`lib/market-radar/`, migration `037_market_radar.sql`, branch `ai-queue/001-market-radar-foundation` — persistence and types only, no UI yet). Seasonal Intelligence is **not yet started**.
- **Wave IV** (Business Pulse + Autopilot) — not started as originally scoped, but several features that read like an organic continuation of it have shipped outside the formal wave numbering (see below).

The 1.0 roadmap (`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`, Phases A–H) runs in parallel and still governs marketing-specific delivery: Phases A–C are largely shipped; **Phases D, E, F, G, H remain scope-only, not shipped.**

**Major completed systems:**
- Authenticated marketing loop: Marketing Director orchestration, recommendations, campaigns, experiments, decision intelligence, strategic calendar, marketing memory (4-layer model), guided onboarding, Assisted Pilot — collectively validated through Release Candidate 1.
- Business Brain intelligence layer (shipped, but **not named in the 2.0 wave roadmap document** — see Open Items): Business Knowledge Graph, Business Learning Engine, Business Brain Inspector, External Intelligence foundation, Business Connections, Opportunity Detection Engine.
- Growth Advisor experience (replaces the previous `/dashboard` composition) and Autonomous Growth Planner (recommend-only, no auto-execution).
- Head of Marketing Orchestrator — the newest merge (PR #96): a daily Executive Review composing Weekly Growth Plan + Executive Brief + Opportunity Engine into one view, at `/dashboard/executive-review` (customer) and `/dashboard/admin/executive-overview` (admin).
- Publishing pipeline with atomic job claiming (background_jobs table + Trigger.dev, two systems not yet merged — see `DECISIONS.md`).

**Current active initiative:** Queue completion-state reconciliation (branch `fix/queue-completion-state-reconciliation`). PR #101 (Task 001 — Market Radar persistence foundation) merged into `main` successfully, but `.ai/queue/QUEUE_STATUS.json` was left recording it as `"in_progress"` — silently blocking Task 002 (`depends_on: ["001"]`) from ever becoming eligible. **Root cause, found by direct git archaeology:** `attemptTask()` in `scripts/ai/run-queue.ts` used to flip the in-memory task status to `"completed"` only *after* `git add -A && git commit` had already run for the task's real work, so the commit that became the PR always carried a stale `"in_progress"` snapshot — merging that PR permanently baked the lie into `main`. Fixed two ways (see `DECISIONS.md` ADR-0014): (1) `attemptTask()` now pushes a final commit recording the true completed state onto the branch before returning; (2) every `npm run ai:queue` invocation now reconciles any stale `"in_progress"` task against real, verified GitHub state (`scripts/ai/reconcile.ts`) before selecting a new task — a defense-in-depth backstop. `npm run ai:queue:status` now distinguishes an actively-running task from a stale-but-merged one from a genuinely-crashed one (previously indistinguishable). Task 001's own `QUEUE_STATUS.json` entry was corrected by hand in this PR using only verified data (branch, real commit SHA, PR URL, PR-creation timestamp, test summary from PR #101's own merged `HANDOFF.md`) — **Task 002 is now confirmed eligible** (`selectNextEligibleTask` returns it against the corrected state). See `HANDOFF.md` for full details and exact next-step commands.

**Known safety gates (must not be silently changed by any agent):**
- `ATTACH_DECLARATIVE_PRODUCTION_CRONS` — the Trigger.dev production-schedule activation gate. **Must remain `false`.** Canonical source: `lib/trigger/scheduleActivation.ts`. Referenced/enforced across ~10+ tests, most `docs/` files, and this repo's own `RUNBOOKS.md` (which treats an accidentally-`true` gate as a severe production-safety incident).
- No automatic merges, no automatic deploys, no automatic production migrations, no automatic secret changes — enforced by process (`AGENTS.md`) and by the queue's `safety:` block (`.ai/queue/RUN_QUEUE.yaml`), not by any code-level lock.

**Current blockers:** see `STATUS.json.current_blockers` and `OPEN_ITEMS.md` (security gap, architecture decision debt, production launch blockers, missing recommendation-engine trigger).

**Recommended next step:** Resolve the three-competing-"what should this business do"-systems architecture question (`docs/ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW_2026.md`) before adding further recommendation/decision surface area. In parallel, patch the spoofable `x-forwarded-for` rate-limit key on the public interactive-demo endpoint (§3.9 of that same review) — it is an active, unbounded-cost-abuse security gap, not a hypothetical one.

**Date last verified:** 2026-08-02
